sentence=PIRSensor provides a class to control a Passive Infrared sensor.
paragraph=These sensors measure IR radiation from an object such as a human and can be used to detect presense of warm objects such as a person or animal.   A common example is an AM312 or an HC-SR501.  These sensors typically have three terminals - VCC, GND, and OUT.  When the PIR sensor detects a presence - meaning it detects the heat generated by a warm body within it's range, it will set the output "open" - so if you have a pull-up resistor, the waveform will be at 0v when nothing is detected and 3.3v when something is detected.
